	These is the time when my life gets harder and harder. We have practicals and researches, that often we do 
	at school. I am tired of my groupmates when we always have those times that they didn't even contribute 
	in the research paper itself. Aside from the bad memories, I also have a lot of memories when my classmates 
	used to give me free things and free foods. As the time passes by I realize those things aren't good for my 
	personality, and I wanted to change those routine of mine. I wanted to have my own things that I can give to 
	others so I can pay them back their kindness to me.<P><P>
