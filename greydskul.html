	In my grade school days, I remember the time when I am always at the list of honor students either I am at 
	the 2nd to 4th place that time. I have a lot of friends that I even barely know in the present day. I am 
	always playing with my PSP and sometimes bring it at school on Christmas Party or in any even at school. 
	Before I graduate in my grade school days, we are being caught and scolded by the teacher because we are 
	doing a bank cards and drawn a wiener on it. I don't even remember or just my parents didn't scolded me at 
	that time.<P><P>
