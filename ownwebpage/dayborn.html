	The date of the day when I was born is on October 29, 2002, at exactly 7:17am. I was so little back then, 
	I am also small right now. Not that small, but everybody seems to be bigger than me. My grandfather always 
	remind me that even though I didn't inherit their height, but I inherited their knowledge and I continue 
	on growing on those intellectual things that I am good at.<P><P>
